      <description>Hello MS/Mr. Viewer, I welcome you to this very blog you see in front of your eye(s). In this blog I will be uploading malware analysis, android internals,android applications and tools I create in my free time. As every project I do I always start with huge excitement which gradually fades. I expect nothing different for this project but I will try to be consistent with a couple posts per month.</description>
